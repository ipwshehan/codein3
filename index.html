          New7Wonders of the World (2000–2007) was a campaign started in 2000 to
          choose Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing
          monuments. The popularity poll was led by Canadian-Swiss Bernard Weber
          and organized by the New7Wonders Foundation based in Zurich,
          Switzerland, with winners announced on 7 July 2007 in Lisbon. The
          New7Wonders Foundation said that more than 100 million votes were cast
          through the Internet or by telephone. Voting via the Internet was
          limited to one vote for seven monuments per person/identity, but
          multiple voting was possible through telephone. Hence the poll was
          considered unscientific. According to John Zogby, founder and current
          President/CEO of the Utica, New York-based polling organization Zogby
          International, New7Wonders Foundation drove "the largest poll on
          record". The program drew a wide range of official reactions. Some
          countries touted their finalist and tried to get more votes cast for
          it, while others downplayed or criticized the contest. After
          supporting the New7Wonders Foundation at the beginning of the campaign
          by providing advice on nominee selection, the United Nations
          Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), by its
          bylaws having to record all and give equal status to world heritage
          sites, distanced itself from the undertaking in 2001 and again in
          2007.

          <h2>Great Wall of China</h2>
          <p>
            The Great Wall of China is the collective name of a series of
            fortification systems generally built across the historical northern
            borders of China to protect and consolidate territories of Chinese
            states and empires against various nomadic groups of the steppe and
            their polities. Several walls were being built from as early as the
            7th century BC by ancient Chinese states; selective stretches
            were later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first
            Emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many
            successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of
            border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by
            the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).<br />

          <h2>Petra</h2>
          <p>
            The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and
            Petra became the focus of their wealth. The Nabataeans were
            accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies,
            and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's
            mountainous terrain. They were particularly skillful in harvesting
            rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. Petra flourished in the
            1st century AD, when its famous Khazneh structure – believed to be
            the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV – was constructed, and its
            population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.<br />

          <h2>Colosseum</h2>
          <p>
            The Colosseum could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at
            various points of its history over the centuries,having an average
            audience of some 65,000;it was used for gladiatorial contests and
            public spectacles such as mock sea battles (for only a short time as
            the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other
            activities), animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous
            battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building
            ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It
            was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters
            for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian
            shrine.<br />

          <h2>Chichen Itza</h2>
          <p>
            Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands
            from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic
            (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period
            (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural
            styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc
            and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of
            central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative
            of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most
            contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya
            styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.<br />

          <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>
          <p>
            Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an
            estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly
            referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar
            icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450
            but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish
            conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish
            during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world
            until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international
            attention in 1911.<br />

          <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
          <p>
            The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983
            for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the
            universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is
            regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a
            symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million
            visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the
            New7Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.<br />

            The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is
            located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain
            in the Tijuca Forest National Park overlooking the city of Rio de
            Janeiro. A symbol of Christianity across the world, the statue has
            also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, and
            is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World. It is made of
            reinforced concrete and soapstone.<br />
